### Power BI Dashboard Design
The Dashboard is highly interactive, beautiful and easy to use. It also features useful filters to
provide more analysis. On the landing page, there is the Overview page with the overview visuals. In addition, there
are menu buttons to navigate between pages. There are also buttons to view either Profit or
Revenue.

### Executive Summary
The global market size for bikes is valued above USD 50 billion. Many people keep biking for
leisure, exercise, or to reduce their environmental carbon footprint. For this, the market size is
expected to grow annually by 8% until 2030. This project analyses bike sales data to gain
market insights and trends into the profits and revenues of bike sales. This analysis covers
product types, countries, customers and how they affect profit and revenue over six years
(2011 to 2016). \
The net profit and sales revenue are seen to increase but experience a drop in 2014 and 2016.
The decline is quite regular, and it can be predicted to occur in 2018 similarly (after an increase
in 2017). The Bike is the most profitable in the product category and the most significant
contributor to profit and sales revenue. The total profits and sales revenue is generated more
from the United States, thus the most profitable country for the company. The country is
followed closely by Australia. Also, Road and Mountain bikes in the Bikes category are the
most significant contributor to total profit and revenue. \
Furthermore, most transaction orders occurred on products with prices between $2 and $120,
with the highest being $5 products followed by $35 products. California in the United States is
the most significant contributor among the states to total profit and revenue. The 'Adult' and
'Young Adults' age groups generally contribute more to the country's profit and revenue.
Finally, the net profit forecast for next year (2017) is $13.41 million with a forecast accuracy of
87.56%. The sales revenue for next year (2017) is $28.04 million with a forecast accuracy of
89.17%. \  
It is recommended that highly performing product category (Bikes), country (United States)
and age groups should be monitored and maintained. Countries like Germany has a very good
cycling culture and a bigger population than Australia. This is potential for better sales in this
country and the company should investigate that. Low performing products should investigated
for ways to improve their performances in the market. Finally, if more quantities of $5 and $35products are sold, then products with prices in between should be investigated as they can
perform better than their current performances
